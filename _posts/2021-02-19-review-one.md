Virtual St. Paul’s Cross Project: A Digital Re-Creation of John Donne’s Gunpowder Day Sermon, London 1622: https://vpcp.chass.ncsu.edu/

**Summary of the project and its purpose**

This review is about the Digital Re-Creation of John Donne’s Gunpowder Day Sermon, London 1622. This re-creation is designed to show the layout and design of St Paul’s Cathedral and in Paul’s Churchyard, as well as the events that unfolded on Gunpowder day.  

**An assessment of the technology used/developed**

To bring this visual model to life, it was created in Google SketchUp. The artists being Joshua Stephens and Jordan Gray (both graduate students in architecture in the College of Design at NC State University). Images from the SketchUp model were then rendered and imported into Photoshop. The technology used produced sophisticated and realistic images. Particularly Paul’s churchyard which was drawn from both a ground level, and bird’s eye view. The ghostly images of people drawn many of the images adds an interesting touch, to a project mainly focuses on architecture. 

**An analysis of the project and its place within existing scholarship and technological practices**

This project features many of the dimensions and inner workings of the cathedral itself. Making it an incredibly useful tool for Historians and/or students interested in finding out more about gunpower day. For example, if you click on Preacher, then click on Donne in 1622 you will see a synopsis of John Donne and the events that led up to his sermon. However, if you click on the website in the beginning you will not get into such detail because that is not the focus of the website. Even though it is helpful information. This organization of information is user friendly because someone can sift through what they find important and/or interesting. 

**An evaluation of the project in relation to professional guidelines for evaluating digital scholarship like those provided by the MLA and AHA, including, where relevant: engagement of new audiences; funding, awards or other recognition; adoption and use of the output by other scholars; and citations of the project in scholarship or press**

The professional guidelines followed are outstanding. Everything is cited under the support section. Anything from the production team, to the advisory team. They included every person, award and/or funding that would be relevant to creating this project. 

**Identification of interesting, outstanding, or problematic issues.**

It was incredibly impressive how many details the creators included in the project. They included everything from the acoustics (how the sermon was heard throughout various places), John Donne (the preacher) and the environment/weather. They even covered the historical time, as well as the social times. Most of the details felt relevant event if it was straying a bit from the event itself. Adding what type of social time, it was (progressive vs conservative) can help understand why certain writings were included in the sermon. It was a great deal of research done just to cover one day in history, over top of creating images of the church itself. 
I did however find the acoustics sections a bit tedious to read as well irrelevant at times. It is understandable the creators wanted to show how the sermon would’ve been heard. However, that could’ve been covered in one, maybe two paragraphs. It didn’t really need its own section or could’ve been under the Occasion/Physical environment section.
