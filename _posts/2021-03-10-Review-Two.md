**Review Two** 


**Project Name: “American Panorama”, Overland Trails (1840-1860) Map**


**Project Director(s): Digital Scholarship Lab. Scott Nesbit contributed substantially to the preliminary drafts.**

**Summary**

This review is about the Digital Humanities project “American Panorama”. “American Panorama” is a collection on United States maps that give a brief history of various topics. This review is about The Overland Trails (1840-1860) Map. These trails seem to be a significant way people migrated throughout America before the eruption of the civil war.

It’s interesting to witness this historical period through a visual medium. When you first click in the map, the first screen gives you directions of how to use this map. This is very helpful before you dive into the rest of the map.

**Overview**

At the top of the map it has 4 icons. One for every trail and the last one being all the trails listed together. The only problem is that when you zoom in on the map, it doesn’t clearly show the locations. Instead the pixels just get blurry and you can't see specific places outside of a few cities. It’s not a dealbreaker, you still get the idea. Just something to keep in mind if you wanted a more detailed map. If your press on one of the trail icons, it shows only the diary entries for people that walked that specific trail. For, example if your press on the Oregon trail button it only shows the diary entrees for people who traveled the Oregon trail. All these features make the map concise and easy to navigate.

**Diary Entries**

Each diary entry gives a timeline of various people on the United States Overland Trails. It’s interesting that they only have one entry for the Mormon Trail. There were slightly less people who traveled that road, but still a considerable number. It would’ve been interesting to know why they only gave one diary entry for that road. The one diary entry for the Mormon trail is done to the same quality as all the others, so you still get an good idea of what it would’ve been like to travel that road (just like all the others).Each diary entry will either give a quote for each character, will tell you where they are headed on that day, and/or what activities they did that day. It would’ve been nice if you didn’t have to click on each entry on to see what it said, but rather if it was laid out in plain sight. That way the whole diary would’ve read seamlessly, rather than being somewhat disjointed.

That is mainly cosmetic though, the diary entrees are still phenomenal. The research on each person was extensive, and each diary was a fleshed out account of each person’s experience traveling their respective trails. 


**Timeline** 

On the bottom it has interesting facts about what was happening that year. At first, I was confused since it looked like map coordinates. However, once I clicked on each number, I realized it was a second timeline connected to the map. Well it was but like map coordinates because when you click on each year on the bottom it also tells you how many people walked the trail. For example, when you pressed on the year 1842, it says” A large wagon train with more than 100 people traveled to Oregon” and 125 people travelled the Oregon trail (none for California and Mormon trail). The use of the vertical space was great. It was divided into four sections (Map, Diary entries, timeline, and interesting facts) with each section providing great information.

**Technology Used**

It doesn’t say what software, or web development tools were used.  


**Sources** 

In the "about this map", it lists the sources and citations as well the work that went into making the map. This was great because you didn’t have to go around looking for the sources, but still tucked in the corner to make a seamless map. Overall, this was a well-researched, carefully made project that educated us on American migration patterns in the mid-19th century.
