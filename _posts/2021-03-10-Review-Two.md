**Review Two** 

**Project Name: “American Panorama”, Overland Trails (1840-1860) Map**

**Project Director(s): Digital Scholarship Lab. Scott Nesbit contributed substantially to the preliminary drafts.**

**Summary**

This review is about the Digital Humanities project “American Panorama”. “American Panorama” is a collection on United States maps, that give a history on the topic the maps are based around. This review is about The Overland Trails (1840-1860) Map. These trails seem to be a significant way people migrated throughout America before the eruption of the civil war.

It’s very interesting to witness this historical period through a visual medium. When you first click in the map, the first screen gives you directions of how to use this map. Which is very helpful before you dive into the rest of the map.

**Overview**

At the top of the map it has 4 icons, one for every trail and the fourth one being all the trails listed together. The only problem being that when you zoom in on the map, it doesn’t clearly show the located. Instead the pixels just get blurry and you can see the specific places outside of a few cities. It’s not a dealbreaker, you still get the idea just something to keep in mind if you wanted a more detailed map. If your press one of the icons, it shows the diary entries only for the people that walked that trail. For, example if your press on the Oregon trail button it only shows the diary entrees for people who traveled the Oregon trail. All these features make the map concise and easy to navigate.

**Diary Entries**

Each diary entry gives a timeline of various people on the United States Overland Trails. It’s interesting that they only have one entry for the Mormon Trail. There were slightly less people who traveled that road, but still a considerable number. It would’ve been interesting to know why they only gave one diary entry for that road. The one diary entry for the Mormon trail is done to the same quality as all the other, so you still get a thorough idea of what it would’ve been like to go on that road (just like all the others).Each diary entry will either give a quote for each character, will tell you where they are headed on that day, and/or what activities they did that day. It would’ve been nice if you didn’t have to click on each entry on to see what it said, but rather if it was laid out in plain sight. That way the whole diary would’ve read seamlessly, rather than being somewhat disjointed.

That is mainly cosmetic though, the diary entrees are still phenomenal. The research on each person was extensive, and each diary was a fully fleshed out recount of each person’s life from 1840 to 1860 traveling each of their respective trails. 


**Timeline** 

On the bottom it has interesting facts of what was happening that year. At first, I was confused since it looked like map coordinates. However, once I clicked on each number, I realized it was a second timeline connected to the map. 
Well it was kind of like map coordinates because it also when you click on each year on the bottom, it will also tell you how many people walked the trail. For example, when you pressed on the year 1841, it says” A large wagon train with more than 100 people traveled to Oregon” and 125 people travelled the Oregon trail (none for California and Mormon trail). The use of the vertical space was great. It was divided in four (Map, Diary entries, timeline, and interesting facts) with each section providing great information.

**Technology Used**

It doesn’t say what software, or web development tools were used.  


**Sources** 

In the about this map, it lists the sources and citations. As well as what when into making this map. This was great because you didn’t have to go around looking for the sources, but still tucked in corner to make a seamless map. Overall, this was a well-researched, carefully made project that educated us on American migration patterns in the 19th century.
