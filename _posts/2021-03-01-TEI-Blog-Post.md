**TEI Blog Post
by: Yashita Prasad**

For our DH class we had to code a section of the Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Stetson. At first it looked really intimidating because it was a completely new coding language then markdown (which we learned for GitHub). At first there was a bit of learning curve, but overall TEI is intuitive.
One of my main problems in the project was catching tiny errors. A mistake I was making initially was not putting the paragraph tags at the beginning and the end. I would get far along and then notice that the box was red. Then I would scramble to try to figure out what I did, think I missed an entire paragraph in my text. Only to discover it was a tiny error. The other tags where easier to remember because you had to look for them, while the paragraph one you had to remember as you code. Another problem I had was when I tried to do an underline. When I copied and pasted the code for underline it didn’t work, then I panicked thinking that if copy and paste didn’t work what else would. Finally, I tried typing it out by and it worked like a charm.

This project helped me pay attention to detail, and to always double check my work. If I didn’t the whole document would read as red, and I would have to go back to the begging and figure out what to do. Once I got past the initial issues, I found the project very enjoyable.  
I never really considered what when into transcribing text online. To me it always seemed like a straightforward process. Especially compared to other more sophisticated and interactive websites, which I imagined required more technical coding skills. However even when doing something as simple as rewriting text, there are still many things you must look out for. Overall, this project was a helpful experience, and helped me gain more insight into websites and coding.
