**TEI Blog Post
by: Yashita Prasad**


For our DH class we had to code a section of the Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Stetson. At first it looked intimidating because it was a new coding language than markdown (which we learned for GitHub). At first there was a bit of learning curve, but overall TEI is intuitive.


One of the main problems I had wth the project was catching tiny errors. A mistake I was initially making was not putting the paragraph tags at the beginning and end. I would get very far along and then notice that the box was red. Then I would scramble and try to figure out what I did wrong, thinking I missed an entire paragraph in my code. Only to discover it was a comma, or colon I missed. The other tags where easier to remember because you had to look for them, while the paragraph one you had to remember as you code. Another problem I had was when I tried to code an underline. When I copied and pasted the code for underline it didn’t work, then I panicked thinking that if copy and paste didn’t work what else would? Finally, I tried typing it out by hand and it worked like a charm.

This project helped me pay attention to detail, and to always double check my work. If I didn’t the whole document would read as red, and I would have to go back to the begging and figure out what to do. Once I got past the initial issues, I found the project very enjoyable.

Before this class, I didn't consider what went into transcribing online text. It always seemed like a straightforward process. Especially compared to other more sophisticated and interactive websites, which I imagined required more technical coding skills. However even when doing something as simple as rewriting text, there are still many things you must look out for. Overall, this project was a great experience, and helped me gain more insight into websites and coding.
