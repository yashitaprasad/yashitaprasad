**Grant Proposal and Reflection**

**Proposal**

For my grant proposal I chose to do mapping a novel. The novel was The Darkest Minds by Alexandra Bracken. The reason I choose this book was because it took place all throughout the United States, anywhere from Virginia to California. Thus, making the project doable in a summer’s worth of time but also giving enough content to map. 


The grant project needed software that could map out the locations. The software I choose was leaflet. Leaflet seemed easy to learn and intuitive. It was affordable as well so if I was satisfied with the map, I created I could keep it up and running for a year or two.

It was interesting going back and re-reading these books after years. Exploring the themes of the story again and made me think more about the book’s central messages. I realized was how much the setting affected the story. I never considered this as I read the books. The setting is almost like a secondary character to the story. For example, when they were near the in Chesapeake the story took on a more ominous feeling, but when they were traveling through the interstates by car the characters seemed more at ease. Before always just seemed like they shifted from one location to the other without giving much though to what they were doing. Which is great since each location that is mapped needs to have some significance, for it to be a good mapping project. 


Writing the grant shifted my perspective on this project. I ended up doing some research on the author’s writing process and intent with this series. Even though she did not intend for it to become an allegory, part of this story is shaped around her experience with 9/11.  About how it shifted her view of this country, and how the U.S handles crisis. 


Further into the grant proposal I had trouble explaining how my project would differentiate itself from other DH projects. This is because novel mapping projects have been done before, in various ways. It seemed like splitting hairs when speaking about how this project was bringing something new to the table. While the Darkest Minds is not unique to being fiction exploring reality, it certainly is more explicit about its parallels than many other works. Which made it even more fun to apply it to a more real-life context, such as mapping. 


The closest projects I could find were mapping projects of older novels (lots of Frankenstein Maps, which was great). Another project I found was the Dubliners project. These were all great resources and helped me figure out how to do my own grant project. 


It was also difficult find scholarly peer review articles because the genre of sci fi dystopian literature is new. It has only been on the rise for a certain number of years and now is having a hiatus due to over saturation in the genre. However, the articles I did find were able to provide great insight. 

**Reflection**

The assignments for Digital Humanities were different from the typical English/Literature classes. Instead of reading texts, we analyzed projects and articles. This was helpful because we learned to apply what we learned in class, in a more real world context.  I really enjoyed doing review two because we got to pick the digital humanities project we review, rather than picking from a list. When we were shown American Panorama in class, I knew immediately I wanted to review one of those maps. They were enjoyable to go through and well researched. 


Digital Humanities has taken on a more practical approach now that I have gone through this course. At first, we were learning about other people’s projects and how the field originated. Now with the projects and blogs we’ve done, it becomes a more interactive way to communicate with other people.
